title: About Jolene Poulin

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>My name is Jolene, but most people call me Jo. I'm currently studying Computing Science at the University of Alberta. 
  While I can't technically have a minor, I'm building up an unofficial minor in German. I speak a total of four languages; English is
my first language, followed by French, Spanish, and German (in that order). I hope to learn more languages as I progress through 
  my degree and my career. I also &quot;speak&quot; a
number of programming languages, including: HTML, CSS, Python, C, C#, Java, JavaScript and limited Objective-C and Swift. <br />
You can see my latest projects linked to my GitHub account below.</p>
