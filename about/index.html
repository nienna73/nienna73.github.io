<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>My name is Jolene, but most people call me Jo. I'm currently studying at the University of Alberta. 
I'm in my second year of my Computing Science with Specialization degree. While I can't technically
have a minor, I'm building up an unofficial minor in German. I speak a total of four languages; English is
my first language, followed by French, Spanish, and German (in that order). I also &quot;speak&quot; a
number of programming languages, including: HTML, CSS, Python, C, C#, and limited Objective-C and Swift.</p>
