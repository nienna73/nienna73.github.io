title: About Jolene Poulin

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>My name is Jolene, but most people call me Jo. I'm currently studying Computing Science at the University of Alberta. 
  While I can't technically have a minor, I'm building up an unofficial minor in German. I speak a total of four languages; English is
my first language, followed by French, Spanish, and German (in that order). I hope to learn more languages as I progress through 
  my degree and my career. I also &quot;speak&quot; a
number of programming languages, including: HTML, CSS, Python, C, C#, Java, JavaScript and limited Objective-C and Swift. <br />
You can see my latest projects linked to my GitHub account below.</p>
<p>In addition to my university education, I've been an active member of the Startup Edmonton Community since 2016. Startup Edmonton has
   taught me so much about the blooming startup companies in the city and has shown me the number of resources available for small companies,
   entrepreneurs, and students alike right here in Edmonton. I'm proud to be part of this community and will continue to support it in any 
  way that I can.</p>
