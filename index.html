          I'm a student studying Computing Science at the University of Alberta. In addition to my major in CS, 
          I have been learning German since year 1, making me pretty darn fluent at this point. I'm always open
          to new opportunities to engage in my community and further my education. I love learning new things 
          and hope to gain real-world experience that will compliment my education. <br />
