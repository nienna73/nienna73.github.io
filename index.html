          I'm a student in my second year at the University of Alberta studying Computing Science. I'm projected to graduate
          in 2021 and I'm currently looking for an internship in a related field. I hope to work in 
          Natural Language Processing (NLP), Web development, or app development. I love learning new things 
          and hope to gain real-world experience that will compliment my education. <br />
