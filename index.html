              <p>
                CMPUT 404 is a web development course offered by the University of Alberta. The term-long project for this course 
                is to create a stand-alone social network and integrate it with another team's project. <a href="http://cmput-404.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Squawk</a> 
                was my group's project. I was largely responsible for making our site responsive with vanilla JavaScript, implementing front-end elements, 
                and coordinating with others to integrate the front and back ends. I also wrote an extensive test suite for the project, including 
                basic tests for the models and automated integration tests for the site functionality. The site is hosted on heroku and uses django 
                for resource management. My team built the platform without the use of any templates or extensive libraries.

                and up-to-date, the contact form does not yet work and there are a few changes I would like to make to the 
                code to automate some content generation. The website is accessible here: <a href="http://uacs.ca/" target="_blank">UACS Website!</a>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">Well Done Studios</div>
              <p>Debbie's Dog Dilemma, created by Well-Done Studios is the final project for the CMPUT 250 course as offered by the University of Alberta 
                  in winter 2018. In this game created using the RPG MV engine, you play as Debbie, an overwhelmed university student struggling to submit 
                  her assignment before the deadline. The problem? Her homework is stolen by a dog! Help her find her homework before the end of the weekend 
                  by completing a variety of puzzles across campus.</p>
                  <p>I was the producer as well as one of three developers for Debbie's Dog Dilemma. As the producer, I helped keep the team on track for deadlines 
                    and submissions, and constantly reminded the team to keep the scope of our project in mind, earning me the honorary title of Scope Whisperer. 
                    As a developer, I worked on the puzzles in the game. This includes the basis of the initial snow puzzles, dodging cats in a small maze, navigating 
                    a poorly constructed building on campus, and playing the piano with your favourite characters from the game!</p>
                  <p>Debbie's Dog Dilemma won multiple awards at the end-of-year awards ceremony, including Story and Design, Artwork, and Game of the Year. It can be

              <div class="subheading mb-3">CMPUT 350 Team</div>
              <p>I was one of four developers on this project where we were tasked to create a bot that would 
                intelligently play StarCraft II (SCII). We played a Terran bot that employed a full rush 
                strategy. I handled the attack patterns and micro-management. These functions determined if 
                our units would attack the weakest enemy or the most dangerous enemy, applied stim-packs when appropriate, 
                and employed kiting to increase the chances of success. SegFault, which is what we named our bot, 
                won second in the class-wide SCII bot tournament held by the TAs at the end of the term. 
                Due to the University's collaboration policy, the shared repo for this project is private.

        <p>In addition to programming languages, I love learning natural languages. I've been learning
           languages other than my native English for as long as I can remember and I'm always looking for ways 
           to improve my language abilities. I also enjoy learning and playing instruments as well as drawing and re-watching Star Trek!
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">My career interests include machine learning, natural language processing, 
          information retrieval, and leadership. I've had the pleasure of leading a few group projects in school 
          and would love to transfers those skills to the work environment.
