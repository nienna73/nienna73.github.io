<dl>
<dt>Women in Scholarship, Engineering, Science, and Technology (WISEST) Summer Research Student</dt>
  <dd>July 2015 - August 2015</dd>
  <dd>As a Summer Research Student, I worked in a Biomechanical Engineering Lab modelling and 3D printing a model of the lower lumbar spine.
  I was largely responsible for creating the model of the intervertebral disc and printing the distinct parts of the display

  were done according to the standards required for such tests and the results were summarized in a paper that was then presented 
  to my supervisors.</dd>
